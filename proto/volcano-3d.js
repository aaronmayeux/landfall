/**
 * volcano-3d.js — REAL MOUNTAINS AT MAP ZOOM. A MapLibre custom layer, drawn
 * with THREE, in MapLibre's own GL context.
 *
 * PROTOTYPE CODE. Not wired into the app.
 *
 * ==> THIS IS THE THIRD AND LAST RUNG OF THE VOLCANO LADDER. <==
 *
 *   Three pips + limb silhouettes   z2.0 → z3.8   proto/volcano-marks.js
 *   MapLibre circles                z2.4 → z7.8   proto/volcano-map.js
 *   Real geometry, this file        z7.0 → up
 *
 * The circle fades out underneath these as they fade in, across
 * `VOLCANO.map3d.handoff`. Aaron's call 2026-07-30: a dot and a mountain for
 * the same volcano at the same time is two marks for one thing.
 *
 * ==> A CORDILLERA IS ONE RIDGE, NOT A ROW OF CONES, AND THAT IS WHY THIS FILE
 * NO LONGER DRAWS ONE MESH PER VOLCANO. <== Arc volcanoes sit 15–25 km apart
 * with 31 km footprints, so they genuinely overlap. One closed shape each gave
 * 126 hard rims crossing one another and read as a smear of stamped coins.
 * Volcanoes whose footprints intersect are now sampled as ONE continuous
 * heightfield with a saddle between the summits — `lib/volcano-ridge.js`, which
 * has no THREE in it and is asserted without a browser.
 *
 * ==> WHAT MAKES THIS WORK WHERE `fill-extrusion` FAILED, IN ONE LINE EACH.
 * <== It failed on glass 2026-07-30 for two reasons (SPEC-GLOBES §42.1.4a).
 * The camera can tilt now (`map/pitch-ramp.js`), so geometry is not seen
 * straight down its own throat. And the footprint is TRUE rather than sized to
 * hit a pixel target, so it cannot blow up at high zoom — Masaya's caldera is
 * about 10 km across here, which is what it is. Neither of those is tuning.
 *
 * ==> THE PROFILE IS NOT REIMPLEMENTED HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THE
 * FILE SPLIT. <== `volcanoProfile()` in `lib/volcano-shape.js` is the only
 * place the silhouette maths lives. The 3D globe runs a GLSL copy of it in a
 * vertex shader because a shader cannot import; `lib/volcano-ridge.js` inverts
 * the same JavaScript original into a radius-to-height table. One silhouette
 * read two ways, never two silhouettes.
 *
 * ==> NO SHADER IS WRITTEN HERE AT ALL, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. <== Light,
 * colour and the soft base are all baked into vertex colours on the CPU when a
 * ridge is built, so there is nothing to fail to compile on a phone GPU and
 * nothing recomputed per frame. Zoom changes touch one matrix per ridge.
 *
 * `THREE` and `maplibregl` are CDN globals, same as `world-deep.js`.
 *
 * Imports: config/ and lib/ only.
